      <h2>Introduction to Blockchain & Crypto</h2>
      <p>
        Blockchain is like a giant public accounting ledger that everyone can see but no one can secretly change. Crypto tokens are the entries in that ledger, acting as digital money or digital assets. This means people can trade directly without banks or middlemen, with instant settlement and 24/7 availability.
