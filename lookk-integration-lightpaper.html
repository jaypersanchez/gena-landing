      <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
      <p>
        <a href="https://lookk.ai" target="_blank">LooKK</a> is an advanced AI-powered recruitment and talent-matching platform that connects candidates with employers using sophisticated algorithms and behavioral data. As part of our broader project ecosystem, we will be integrating LooKK’s technology to complement our initiatives in decentralized opportunities, talent marketplaces, and AI-driven user empowerment.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, data from LooKK — including job postings, anonymized talent skills, job descriptions, and job preferences (excluding any personal identifying information) — will help train and continuously improve Virland AI’s capabilities. This strategic data use allows Virland AI to better understand market demands, behavioral patterns, and decision processes relevant to the trading and employment ecosystem.
